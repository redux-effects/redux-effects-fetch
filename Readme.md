# redux-effects-fetch

Declarative data fetching for [redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux). Build on top of [isomorphic-fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch) so it works everywhere.

## Installation

`npm install redux-effects-fetch`

## Usage

This package is designed to be used in conjunction with [redux-effects](https://github.com/redux-effects/redux-effects).  Install it like this:

```javascript
import effects from 'redux-effects'
import fetch, { fetchEncodeJSON } from 'redux-effects-fetch'

// fetchEncodeJSON is optional
applyMiddleware(effects, fetch, fetchEncodeJSON)(createStore)
```

This will enable your middleware to support fetch actions.

## Actions

You can create your own action creators for this package, or you can use the one that comes bundled with it.  The action format is simple:

```javascript
{
  type: 'EFFECT_FETCH',
  payload: {
    url,
    params
  },
  meta: { timeout }
}
```

Where `url` and `params` are what you would pass as the first and second arguments to the native `fetch` API. Third argument is action meta: `timeout` - the numerical value (in ms) which is used for rejecting request promise if it takes longer time to complete than the value of this property.

If you want your action creators to support some async flow control, you should use [redux-effects](https://github.com/redux-effects/redux-effects)' `bind` function.  If you do, your fetch action will return you an object with the following properties:

  * `url` - The url of the endpoint you requested (as returned by the request)
  * `status` - The numerical status code of the response (e.g. 200)
  * `statusText` - The text version of the status (e.g. 'OK')
  * `headers` - A [Headers object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers)
  * `value` - The deserialized value of the response.  This may be an object or string, depending on the type of response (json or text).

## Examples

### Creating a user

```javascript
import {bind} from 'redux-effects'
import {fetch} from 'redux-effects-fetch'
import {createAction} from 'redux-actions'

function signupUser (user) {
  return bind(fetch(api + '/user', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: user
  }), ({value}) => userDidLogin(value), ({value}) => setError(value))
}

const userDidLogin = createAction('USER_DID_LOGIN')
const setError = createAction('SET_ERROR')
```

This works exactly as if you were working with the native `fetch` API, except your request is actually being executed by middleware.

### Handling loading states

For this I recommend the use of [redux-multi](https://github.com/ashaffer/redux-multi), which allows you to dispatch more than one action at a time.

```javascript
import {bind} from 'redux-effects'
import {fetch} from 'redux-effects-fetch'
import {createAction} from 'redux-actions'

function signupUser (user) {
  return [
    signupIsLoading(),
    bind(fetch(api + '/user', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: user
    }, { timeout: 10000 }), ({value}) => userDidLogin(value), ({value}) => setError(value))
  ]
}

const signupIsLoading = createAction('SIGNUP_IS_LOADING')
const userDidLogin = createAction('USER_DID_LOGIN')
const setError = createAction('SET_ERROR')
```

## Local development

If you want to develope your frontend application without any REST server running,
you can use [redux-effects-fetch-fixture](https://github.com/team-boris/redux-effects-fetch-fixture) to define
fixtures for your `fetch` requests.
